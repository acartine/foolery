    "body": "Introduce a lightweight coverage regression mechanism that warns (not blocks) when coverage drops. Approach:\n1. Add a coverage threshold check to the existing CI workflow or coverage.yml\n2. Compare current coverage against a baseline stored in the repo (e.g. coverage-baseline.json)\n3. On regression: post a warning comment on the PR or annotate the workflow summary — do NOT fail the build\n4. On improvement: auto-update the baseline\n5. Add a simple script (e.g. scripts/check-coverage.mjs) that:\n   - Reads coverage-summary.json from vitest output\n   - Compares against baseline\n   - Exits 0 always (soft gate) but prints clear warnings if coverage dropped\n   - Optionally uses GitHub Actions annotations (::warning::) for visibility\n6. Store baseline as coverage-baseline.json in repo root (committed)\n\nKeep it painless: no external services, no build failures, just visibility. The goal is awareness — developers see when they're regressing and can make informed decisions.",
