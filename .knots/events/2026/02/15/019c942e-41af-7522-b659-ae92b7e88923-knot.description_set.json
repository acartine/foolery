    "description": "Let's rewrite the README so it looks more like a typical readme (use the steve yegge beads repo as a kind of example)\n\nwe should describe foolery as \"Product focused agentic orchestration tool - one layer up from managing 8 agent terminals, one level down from massively multi-agent chaos.\"\n\nproblems it solves:\n\nrapid scratch pad for small bugs and big ideas alike\nleverage agents to organize groups of work and optimize them for parallel execution\ntrack \"completed\" work units in a first-class way, accept or reject them with notes.\n\nand anything else you think cool about the app.  :-)\n\nwe want to highlight the git driven install flow (the one liner) as a quick start - noting beads as a requirement\n\nwe want to highlight the beats, scenes, direct, and final cut views - brief descriptions of what they do, with placeholders for screenshots."
