    "content": "Feedback from verification:\n\n- Remove redundant `Wave {name}:` text from each group card; the top-left wave label already provides the name and this is clutter.\n- `Shift+[` / `Shift+]` navigation is not behaving as expected.\n- With a single tree, cycling should still work: treat that tree as a master root and cycle across its first-level children.\n- With multiple trees (e.g., 8), treat a master root as implicit and cycle across trees.\n- Users should be able to drill down one level and still move across siblings with `Shift+[` / `Shift+]`.\n- Prefer replacing this model with arrow-key navigation (`Up` / `Down` / `Left` / `Right`) for simpler mental mapping.\n- Never allow navigating so far \"up\" that lateral movement across siblings is impossible.",
