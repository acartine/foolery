    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1770992624769-htws6w.\nObjective: Close Wave 1 epic and unblock Wave 2 epic\nAgent plan:\n- 1 x lead (planning)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-060: Wave 1: Verify in-flight + quick UI fixes\n- foolery-5mt: Wave 2: Hotkey features + unblock terminal/orchestration\nNotes: foolery-060 closes after waves 1+2 complete. foolery-5mt unblocks once 060 is closed. This is the orchestration handoff point.\nAssumptions:\n- External dependency foolery-s3q is assumed resolvable — if not, foolery-cxc moves to wave 2 or is flagged blocked.\n- foolery-wrb is treated as a separate task from foolery-a3b despite identical titles (wrb appears to be the open redo of the verified a3b).\n- Wave epics (060, 5mt) are coordination beads — 060 closes when its child work is done, 5mt opens for planning.\n- Non-P0 beads (P1, P2, P4) are excluded per planning objective."
