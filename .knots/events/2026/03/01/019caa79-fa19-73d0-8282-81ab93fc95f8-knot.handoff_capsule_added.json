    "content": "Implementation review complete. Fixed 3 issues: (1) consolidated duplicate OpenRouterModel type to single canonical source in openrouter.ts, (2) replaced duplicated formatCost function in settings UI component with imported formatPricing from library, (3) added 5 new unit tests for fetchOpenRouterModels and validateOpenRouterApiKey API client functions. All quality gates pass: 0 lint errors, clean typecheck, 937 tests passing (11 openrouter tests). Build failure is pre-existing/unrelated (SSR useContext issue on /beads page). Commit: 26712a8",
