    "description": "Add a 'foolery setup' subcommand (like 'bd setup') that runs interactive configuration after install. This replaces the wizard prompts that were embedded in install.sh (which never fired because curl|bash pipes stdin). Setup should: (1) run the repo discovery wizard (scan for local clones with .beads/, offer to mount them), (2) run the agent discovery wizard (scan for claude/codex/gemini, prompt for action mappings and models). Install.sh should be made silent (no interactive prompts) and print a hint to run 'foolery setup' afterward. Consolidates work from cxcv (repo wizard) and 31ho (agent wizard) into a proper post-install command."
