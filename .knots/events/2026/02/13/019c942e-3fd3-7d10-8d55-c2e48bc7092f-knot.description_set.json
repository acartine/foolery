    "description": "for now let's keep it simple, nobody can ship if something is shipping.  disable all the labels.  for the ticket that is actively shipping, change the ship button to a green Shipping... text, add a red square next to it with a mouseover that says 'Terminating'.  on click it terminates the terminal process and then the selected task becomes shippable again."
