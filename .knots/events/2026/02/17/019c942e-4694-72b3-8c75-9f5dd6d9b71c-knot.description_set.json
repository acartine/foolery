    "description": "The write_launcher() heredoc uses unquoted <<LAUNCHER, so bash expands color variables (GREEN, RED, etc.) during heredoc generation. Since these are not defined in install.sh scope, set -u causes 'unbound variable' error during 'foolery update'. Fix: escape all color variable references with backslash-dollar."
