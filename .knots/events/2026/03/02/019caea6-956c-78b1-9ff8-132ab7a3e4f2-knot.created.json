For example, you can say you want 50% of impl steps to be Claude Sonnet 4.6, 25% to be Claude Opus 4.6, 25% to be OpenAI Codex 5.3.\n\nthe value of this is multi-fold:\n\n1) Distribute work to manage account quotas\n2) Track performance - which guys are faster\n3) Failover - we can have circuit breaks that capture when agents return errors or rate limits, and move on to the next agent type until a recovery is detected.\n\n",
