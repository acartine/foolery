    "content": "Implemented startup message type index build in src/instrumentation.ts. The full feature was already 95% built across agent-message-type-index.ts (core logic: build, update, remove, persistence), API route (message-types/route.ts), client fetch (agent-message-type-api.ts), UI consumer (interaction-picker.tsx), and post-session hook (terminal-manager.ts:747). The missing piece was proactive startup initialization — now when Foolery starts, register() checks for the persisted index, builds it from the 2 most recent logs if absent, and logs progress to the console. Uninstall cleanup is handled by the launcher script removing ~/.config/foolery/ entirely. All 91 test files pass (1633 tests). Commit 808c79e pushed to origin/main.",
