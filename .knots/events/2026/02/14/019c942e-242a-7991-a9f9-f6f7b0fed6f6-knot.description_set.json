    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1771056565972-1uqa0k.\nObjective: Verify and close the two beads already in progress\nAgent plan:\n- 1 x fullstack (verification)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-c47: wave tree shows closed parents and omits wave id in title\n- foolery-l8n: toggling between orchestrate and list throws away all the orchestration state\nNotes: c47 has stage:verification label — verify the fix landed. l8n is blocked by foolery-6qg (outside P0 set) — confirm blocker is resolved before verifying.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-6qg (blocker for l8n) is resolved or nearly resolved since l8n is already in_progress\n- Wave tags (i22) and wave tree (c47) changes don't conflict\n- Film metaphor changes (glj, s2x, pil) can be implemented together without conflicting with hotkey work in wave 1\n- Keyboard shortcuts helper (j4z) should be updated last to capture all binding changes from earlier waves"
