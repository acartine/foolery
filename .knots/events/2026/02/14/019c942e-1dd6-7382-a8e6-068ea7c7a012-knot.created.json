Agent-1 handles branding trio (glj, s2x, pil) which are thematically linked. Agent-2 handles j4z after wave 1 merges.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-6qg (blocker for l8n) is resolved or nearly resolved since l8n is already in_progress\n- Wave tags (i22) and wave tree (c47) changes don't conflict\n- Film metaphor changes (glj, s2x, pil) can be implemented together without conflicting with hotkey work in wave 1\n- Keyboard shortcuts helper (j4z) should be updated last to capture all binding changes from earlier waves",
