    "description": "Agent interaction logs (.jsonl) grow fast (~200KB per session). Need a lifecycle policy covering: 1) When to compress/archive old logs (e.g. gzip after N days), 2) When to remove logs entirely (e.g. delete after N days/weeks), 3) Whether to enforce max total size. Applies to both dev (.foolery-logs/) and prod (~/.config/foolery/logs/) paths. Design decisions needed before implementation."
