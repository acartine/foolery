Each tab is independent.\n\n2. **Filters (status/type/priority)** — Zustand in-memory store\n   - Same as activeRepo — per-tab, no cross-tab conflict\n   - VERDICT: Safe.\n\n3. **Search query** — URL search params (?q=...)\n   - Encoded in URL, not shared across tabs\n   - VERDICT: Safe.\n\n4. **View mode, command palette state, row selection, focused row** — Zustand + React state\n   - All per-tab, in-memory\n   - VERDICT: Safe.\n\n5. **Page size preference** — localStorage (foolery-page-size)\n   - Shared across ALL tabs/windows on the same origin\n   - If a user changes page size in Tab A, Tab B will pick it up on next read (e.g., after page refresh or re-mount)\n   - NOT a conflict issue — this is a benign user preference, and cross-tab sharing is actually desirable\n   - VERDICT: Safe. Shared intentionally.\n\n6. **Registry (repo list)** — File on disk (~/.config/foolery/registry.json)\n   - Server-side, read from disk on every API call (no caching)\n   - Adding/removing repos in one tab is visible to other tabs on next refetch (TanStack Query polling)\n   - VERDICT: Safe. File-based, no concurrent write locking needed for this low-frequency operation.\n\n7. **Bead data (CRUD)** — Delegated to `bd` CLI, which operates on .beads/issues.jsonl files\n   - All mutations go through the bd CLI which handles its own file locking\n   - Server is stateless — no in-process cache of bead data\n   - Multiple tabs can update beads concurrently; each sees updates via polling\n   - VERDICT: Safe. Stateless server + CLI handles concurrency.\n\n### Cross-Tab Behavior Summary\n- **No shared mutable client state** between tabs (Zustand is per-instance)\n- **No BroadcastChannel, SharedWorker, or storage event listeners** for cross-tab sync\n- **Polling (10s interval)** provides eventual consistency across tabs for server data\n- The only shared state (localStorage page-size) is a benign preference\n\n### Potential Improvements (Not Bugs)\n- Cross-tab sync of activeRepo selection could be added via localStorage + storage events or BroadcastChannel, but this is a UX preference, not a bug\n- TanStack Query's refetchOnWindowFocus (default: true) helps tabs stay fresh when switching between them\n\n### Conclusion\n**No multi-client issues found.** The architecture correctly isolates per-tab UI state in Zustand (in-memory only, no persist middleware) and delegates all data mutations to the stateless server/CLI layer. Multiple open clients operate independently without conflicts.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cartine@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T07:10:19.400035+01:00","created_by":"Andrew Cartine","updated_at":"2026-02-11T12:22:36.138879+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T12:22:36.138879+01:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

The observed stack trace/diff matches this exactly (`disabled=\"\"` vs `disabled={false}`, title text changes, and `\u003ca\u003e` vs `\u003cbutton\u003e` mismatch).\n\n## Proposed Fix\n1. Make initial client render deterministic with SSR.\n   - Initialize store with SSR-safe defaults only (`activeRepo: null`, `filters: {}`) in `src/stores/app-store.ts`.\n   - Move localStorage hydration into a client-only effect after mount (either explicit `hydrateFromStorage()` action or Zustand persist with controlled rehydrate).\n2. Prevent element-type branch flips before hydration.\n   - In `AppHeader`, gate repo-dependent controls behind a hydration-ready flag, or render a stable fallback that keeps identical element structure through first paint.\n   - Specifically avoid swapping between `Button asChild \u003cLink\u003e` and normal `\u003cButton\u003e` during initial hydration window.\n3. Add regression protection.\n   - Test that loading `/beads` with a saved active repo does not emit hydration mismatch warnings.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- No hydration mismatch warning on initial load of `/beads` in dev or production builds.\n- Server and first client render output for header controls are structurally consistent.\n- Repo-dependent controls update correctly after client hydration completes.\n","acceptance_criteria":"No hydration mismatch warnings on initial /beads load; header renders same structure on SSR and first client paint; repo controls update after hydration without tree regeneration","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"cartine@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:47:20.688199+01:00","created_by":"Andrew Cartine","updated_at":"2026-02-15T09:29:59.807278+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"foolery-b3v","depends_on_id":"foolery-7zn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-14T17:55:55.648574+01:00","created_by":"Andrew Cartine"}]}

Three root causes found and fixed in this session.","notes":"# Handoff Capsule — foolery-ez2 (Session 2)\n\n## Context\nShip Now terminal was failing to do actual work. Three issues addressed in this session.\n\n## Fixes applied (all committed \u0026 pushed to main)\n\n### Fix 1: `--output-format=stream-json` requires `--verbose` (d194a07)\n- **Error**: `Error: When using --print, --output-format=stream-json requires --verbose`\n- **Cause**: Claude CLI enforces that stream-json with `-p` also needs `--verbose`\n- **Fix**: Added `--verbose` to the spawn args\n- **File**: `src/lib/terminal-manager.ts:153`\n\n### Fix 2: Plan mode stall — agent planned but never implemented (72ffcfc → 5e83f1a)\n- **Symptom**: Agent entered plan mode, wrote a plan, called ExitPlanMode, process ended without implementing\n- **Cause**: In `-p` (print) mode, ExitPlanMode requires user confirmation that can't happen non-interactively\n- **First attempt** (72ffcfc): Added prompt instruction \"do NOT use plan mode\" — user rejected this, wants plan mode because Claude does better work with a self-generated plan\n- **Final fix** (5e83f1a): Added `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to CLI args — auto-approves ExitPlanMode and all permission prompts. User has already consented by clicking Ship Now.\n- **File**: `src/lib/terminal-manager.ts:151-156`\n\n### Verification\n- Commit `1c6bf14` shows a successful Ship Now run landed the foolery-6xc pagination fix, confirming the terminal is now producing real work\n\n## Current CLI args\n```ts\nconst args = [\n  \"-p\", prompt,\n  \"--verbose\",\n  \"--output-format\", \"stream-json\",\n  \"--dangerously-skip-permissions\",\n];\n```\n\n## Current prompt\n```\nImplement the following task.
