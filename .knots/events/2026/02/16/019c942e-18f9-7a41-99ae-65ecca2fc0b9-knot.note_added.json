    "content": "Implemented scripts/install.sh with production build/install flow and launcher lifecycle commands (foolery start|stop|restart|status). Launcher now starts backend detached, writes stdout/stderr logs, tracks PID, supports restart/stop, and auto-opens browser on start. Validated via temp-prefix smoke test using install + start + status + restart + stop.\nFollow-up: installer now installs from GitHub Release runtime artifacts instead of cloning repository, while preserving foolery start|stop|restart|status lifecycle behavior and log/PID management.\nLauncher lifecycle behavior re-validated from release-installed runtime: start/status/stop produced expected PID/log handling and clean shutdown.\nCorrection: installed launcher now runs via node + Next binary (no bun runtime dependency). Verified with release artifact install and start/stop lifecycle on 2026-02-16.\nAdjusted launcher start behavior: by default, foolery start now prints PID/log paths and returns immediately while service continues in background. Added optional blocking readiness mode via FOOLERY_WAIT_FOR_READY=1.\nAdded lifecycle command: foolery uninstall. It stops running backend, then executes cleanup from a temporary script and removes runtime bundle, local state/logs, and launcher binary.",
