It now uses the core instructions, objective, and explicit in-scope bead IDs when available.\n- Startup no longer fans out dependency lookups across every bead before launching the agent.\n- Direct UI now shows Waiting on agent status/badges while no real agent output has arrived.\n- Verification completed: bun run test passed, bun run build passed, bun run lint passed with pre-existing warnings unrelated to this change.\nHandoff capsule (2026-02-20, commit 09a79ad):\n- Added new History view tab and pane for implementation-focused agent interactions (Take!/Scene only).\n- Left pane lists beats with Take!/Scene logs sorted by most recently worked.\n- Right pane shows chronological app↔agent logs (session start/end, prompts, responses) with prompt-source labels.\n- Added /api/agent-history plus log parsing for .jsonl/.jsonl.gz histories.\n- Updated terminal prompt logging to capture follow-up/auto prompts, not just initial prompts.\n- Verification: bun run test (pass), bun run lint (pass with pre-existing warnings in bead-form.tsx and verification-orchestrator.ts), bun run build (pass).\nHandoff capsule (2026-02-20, commit b3c2c55):\n- Reduced typography scale across Agent History view.\n- Top row now 50/50: left title selector and right beat-details panel with matched fixed height.\n- Left selector shows 5 titles at a time with scrolling and explicit Last updated metadata.\n- Right details panel is scrollable and includes beat metadata/description/acceptance/notes.\n- History feed moved below top row and styled as a dark terminal-like console with App -> Agent / Agent -> App direction labels.\n- Agent history API now supports sinceHours; view requests last 24h and filters to recent beats.\n- Verification: bun run test (pass), bun run lint (pass with pre-existing warnings in bead-form.tsx and verification-orchestrator.ts), bun run build (pass).",
