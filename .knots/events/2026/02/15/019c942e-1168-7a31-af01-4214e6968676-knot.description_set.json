    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1771135456795-enwv4l.\nObjective: Implement the three remaining open p0 beads: tab flicker-close on process complete, bead filter focus return, and filter keyboard shortcut visibility bug\nAgent plan:\n- 2 x frontend (terminal tab UX and bead table interaction)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-59o: when process completes, flicker for the tab for 5 seconds and then close unless clicked on\n- foolery-ra5: after selecting bead filter, focus should return to top row\n- foolery-tgz: changing filter shows keyboard shortcuts even if user explicitly turned them off\nNotes: foolery-ra5 has attempts:2 with stage:retry — most at-risk item, review both prior attempts before coding. All three items are independent and can be parallelized across agents.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-d6d and foolery-hw7 are already closed/landed, so their dependent p0 beads are unblocked\n- Items in stage:verification have code already committed but need confirmation that fixes are correct\n- Retry items may need re-implementation if prior fixes are insufficient\n- All non-p0 beads are deferred to unassigned"
