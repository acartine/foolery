Needs fresh implementation attempt.\n- 563 (wave bead relationships): OPEN, stage:retry, attempts:1. Needs fresh implementation attempt.\n- a3b (orchestration console parsing): IN_PROGRESS, no labels. Status unknown -- needs check.\n- jac (orchestration waves -> trigger now): IN_PROGRESS, no labels. Status unknown -- needs check.\n- cxc (multi terminal): IN_PROGRESS. External blocker s3q is CLOSED. Can proceed.\n\nWAVE 1 UI (060) - OPEN, 5 children (2 closed, 3 open):\n- 11j: CLOSED (done)\n- gps: CLOSED (done)\n- iki (cmd shift R): OPEN, no work started. Dual-parented under 060 and 6qg.\n- k18 (default repo state): OPEN, no work started. Dual-parented under 060 and 6qg.\n- smj (remove header text): OPEN, no work started. Dual-parented under 060 and 6qg.\n\nEXTERNAL DEPS RESOLVED:\n- s3q (ship vs shipping states): CLOSED. Blocker for cxc is cleared.\n- mqv.2.6 (orchestration command center): CLOSED. Removed from 5mt scope.\n\nBLOCKING CHAIN: td6 <- 6qg <- 53d\nUntil 53d children resolve, 6qg stays blocked, and td6 cannot complete handoff.\n\nACTIONABLE ITEMS (priority order):\n1. Re-attempt 32r (bug fix, stage:retry)\n2. Re-attempt 563 (relationship creation, stage:retry)\n3. Get status on a3b, jac (in_progress but stale?)\n4. Verify cxc now that s3q blocker is cleared\n5. Ship iki, k18, smj (pure UI tasks, no technical blockers)",
