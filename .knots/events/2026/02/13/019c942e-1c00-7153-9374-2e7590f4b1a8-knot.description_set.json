Blockers must clear before these start. foolery-75n and foolery-ajb are independent and can begin immediately.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-s3q (not in p0 set) will be resolved before wave 2 items that depend on it\n- foolery-mqv.2.5 and foolery-mqv.5 (p1, stage:verification) will pass verification and unblock foolery-mqv.2.6\n- foolery-iki and foolery-k18 are related enough to assign to one agent\n- foolery-11j verification requires manual QA or automated test confirmation"
