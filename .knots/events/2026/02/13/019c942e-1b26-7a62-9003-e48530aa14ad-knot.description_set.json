    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1770992624769-htws6w.\nObjective: Close out all P0 beads currently in_progress or in stage:verification/retry\nAgent plan:\n- 3 x fullstack (verification)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-32r: clicking thumbs down doesn't remove stage:verification label\n- foolery-a3b: improved parsing and display of orchestration console\n- foolery-cxc: multi terminal support\n- foolery-jac: orchestration waves should flow nicely into trigger now\n- foolery-563: create wave beads doesn't create relationships\nNotes: foolery-32r is a bug fix. foolery-a3b/cxc/jac need verification sign-off. foolery-563 is a retry. foolery-cxc has external dep on foolery-s3q — confirm resolved before starting.\nAssumptions:\n- External dependency foolery-s3q is assumed resolvable — if not, foolery-cxc moves to wave 2 or is flagged blocked.\n- foolery-wrb is treated as a separate task from foolery-a3b despite identical titles (wrb appears to be the open redo of the verified a3b).\n- Wave epics (060, 5mt) are coordination beads — 060 closes when its child work is done, 5mt opens for planning.\n- Non-P0 beads (P1, P2, P4) are excluded per planning objective."
