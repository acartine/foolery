    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1771131013094-yumlqg.\nObjective: Keyboard shortcuts layout, remove legacy navigation, fix wave view ID prefixes, and focus management after filter selection\nAgent plan:\n- 2 x frontend (ui)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-517: keyboard shortcuts needs to be in 2 columns\n- foolery-98w: Remove legacy navigation from Scenes\n- foolery-mr0: wave view, child beats shouldn't show project prefix in front of beat id\n- foolery-ra5: after selecting bead filter, focus should return to top row\nNotes: foolery-ra5 blocked by foolery-cgc — assumed resolved given retry status. All are independent UI tasks.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-b9r (blocker for c47) is resolved — c47 is tagged stage:retry with 1 attempt\n- foolery-cgc (blocker for i22, ra5) is resolved — both are tagged stage:retry\n- Waves can run sequentially but Wave 2 beads have no hard dependency on Wave 1 — sequencing is for practical agent management\n- All unassigned beads are P1+ priority and excluded from this P0 plan"
