    "content": "Implemented coverage badge and CI reporting. Commit 499ac8b adds: (1) json-summary reporter to vitest.config.ts, (2) .github/workflows/coverage.yml that runs coverage on push to main, extracts line% via node, generates shields.io endpoint JSON, and deploys it to a coverage orphan branch, (3) updated ci.yml to run test:coverage instead of test, (4) shields.io endpoint badge in README.md. Badge will be live after first CI run on main creates the coverage branch. Current line coverage: 80.55%.",
