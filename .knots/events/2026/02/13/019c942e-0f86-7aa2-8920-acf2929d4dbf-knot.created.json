Here's the summary:\n\n**Bug**: `task aws:model:train-remote` failed at `pull_results` with \"No --output-dir and no --feature-dir\" when `--feature-dir` wasn't explicitly passed.\n\n**Root cause**: Commit `c990813` (PR #824) changed `_step_pull_results` to use `config.feature_dir` for the local results path, but `_step_upload_features` never wrote the auto-discovered feature dir back to config/state.\n\n**Fix**: Added 3 lines to `_step_upload_features` in `scripts/aws/orchestrate.py:314-316` to propagate the discovered path from the upload result manifest to `config.feature_dir` and `state.feature_dir`.\n\n**Verification**: `make model-sanity` green (1397 passed, 10 skipped).\n\n**PR**: https://github.com/acartine/brutus/pull/842Done.
