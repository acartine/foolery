    "content": "Fixed: Added fallback in buildTakePrompt (knots-backend.ts) when kno claim fails for ready_for_* states. New skillPrompt() and nextKnot() functions in knots.ts wrap kno skill and kno next CLI commands. When claim fails, the backend now tries kno show + kno skill to construct a prompt manually, then advances state via kno next. Tests added for both success and failure fallback paths.
