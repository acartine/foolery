    "description": "Add a dedicated Agent History view focused on implementation-producing agent interactions. Show only beats with Take!/Scene history updated in the last 24 hours. Layout: top row split 50/50 with a left title-selection list (5 visible items, scrollable) and a right beat-details panel of exact matching height (scrollable when content overflows). Add clear 'Last updated' metadata in titles/details. Place the full chronological app<->agent interaction log below in a terminal-style dark presentation with direction labels (App -> Agent, Agent -> App). Out of scope: Breakdown and Direct workflows."
