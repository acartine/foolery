    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1771056565972-1uqa0k.\nObjective: Implement hotkey additions, filter persistence, focus behavior, and layout alignment fixes\nAgent plan:\n- 3 x frontend (svelte-ui)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-2eh: in list view, child task overview under title is not aligned with the title\n- foolery-6m7: shift-c should close focused bead in list view\n- foolery-dgx: reload clears search filters, very annoying\n- foolery-fon: shift-] and shift-[ should toggle between views\n- foolery-ra5: after selecting bead filter, focus should return to top row\n- foolery-i22: don't show wave tags\nNotes: Split across 3 agents: agent-1 handles hotkeys (6m7, fon), agent-2 handles filters/focus (dgx, ra5), agent-3 handles layout/tags (2eh, i22). All are independent — maximum parallelism.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-6qg (blocker for l8n) is resolved or nearly resolved since l8n is already in_progress\n- Wave tags (i22) and wave tree (c47) changes don't conflict\n- Film metaphor changes (glj, s2x, pil) can be implemented together without conflicting with hotkey work in wave 1\n- Keyboard shortcuts helper (j4z) should be updated last to capture all binding changes from earlier waves"
