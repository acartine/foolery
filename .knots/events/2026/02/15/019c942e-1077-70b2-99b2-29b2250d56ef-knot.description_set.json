    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1771135456795-enwv4l.\nObjective: Validate all p0 beads currently in stage:verification — confirm fixes landed correctly, especially retry items that failed on first attempt\nAgent plan:\n- 2 x frontend (UI verification and regression check)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-0j4: Investigate and fix bead action latency (~10s)\n- foolery-3no: Rolling... with stop button table cell gets cut off\n- foolery-brt: tab title blue dot in console should not keep flickering after process is complete\n- foolery-c47: wave tree shows closed parents and omits wave id in title\n- foolery-fo1: Prevent duplicate beat creation on repeated Done clicks\n- foolery-i22: don't show wave tags\nNotes: foolery-c47 (attempts:1) and foolery-i22 (attempts:1) both carry stage:retry — review prior fix diffs and failure context before verifying. If any verification fails, re-implement within this wave.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-d6d and foolery-hw7 are already closed/landed, so their dependent p0 beads are unblocked\n- Items in stage:verification have code already committed but need confirmation that fixes are correct\n- Retry items may need re-implementation if prior fixes are insufficient\n- All non-p0 beads are deferred to unassigned"
