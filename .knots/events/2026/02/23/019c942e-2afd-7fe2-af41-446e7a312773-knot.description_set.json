    "description": "as title says.  current implementation of Breakdown from Create New and Beat Detail lightbox is entirely broken.  All it does is open a Direct view with no prompt.  This is a clear regression from historical behavior.\n\nwhat it should do is open the Direct view, populate the prompt with something like 'break beat xyz down into a hierarchical group of beats', and trigger the run action.\n\nmake both flows work the same, in the proper way."
