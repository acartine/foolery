    "content": "Implementation plan:\n1. Added `repoWriteQueues` Map keyed by resolved repo path\n2. Added `withWriteSerialization<T>()` promise-chain queue (same pattern as bd.ts but without OS-level locks)\n3. Added `execWrite()` wrapper that routes through serialization\n4. Changed 6 write operations (newKnot, claimKnot, pollKnot, updateKnot, addEdge, removeEdge) to use execWrite\n5. Left 5 read operations (listKnots, listProfiles, listWorkflows, showKnot, listEdges) on unserialized exec\n6. Exported _pendingWriteCount() test helper\n7. Added 5 tests in knots-write-serialization.test.ts verifying serialization, concurrent reads, mixed read/write, cleanup, and error recovery",
