    "description": "Generated by orchestration session orch-1771568848826-x9e0uk.\nObjective: Deliver ReTakes view showing closed beads sorted by last-updated timestamp, with robust UX states and verification.\nAgent plan:\n- 1 x backend (bead query and sort contract)\n- 1 x frontend (view, routing, and states)\n- 1 x qa (regression and ordering validation)\nAssigned beads:\n- foolery-seev: add a view ReTakes that shows closed beads in order of last updated\nNotes: Scene 1 (serial): lock filter/sort contract for closed beads. Scene 2 (parallel): backend selector/query and frontend route/view scaffold. Scene 3 (serial): integrate data and state handling (loading, empty, error). Scene 4 (serial): automated and manual validation of ordering and closed-only membership.\nAssumptions:\n- Closed beads can be identified from existing bead status values without schema changes.\n- Each bead has a reliable updated timestamp usable for descending sort.\n- ReTakes can be added as a new view entry without altering existing workflow semantics."
