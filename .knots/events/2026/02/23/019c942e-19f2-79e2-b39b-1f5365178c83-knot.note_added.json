    "content": "Handoff capsule (2026-02-23): Added animated waiting-word spinner for Direct and Breakdown quiet-run states. New shared formatter + hook in src/lib/wait-spinner.ts and src/hooks/use-wait-spinner.ts, wired into src/components/orchestration-view.tsx and src/components/breakdown-view.tsx. Added unit tests in src/lib/__tests__/wait-spinner.test.ts. Quality gates passed: bun run lint (warnings only), bunx tsc --noEmit, bun run test, bun run build. Commit/push: e197d34 pushed to origin/main. Note: bd sync is unstable in this environment (worktree run hangs; repo-root run panics with Dolt nil-pointer), so sync step could not complete successfully.",
