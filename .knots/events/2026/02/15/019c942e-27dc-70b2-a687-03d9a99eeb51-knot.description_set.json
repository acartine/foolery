Prioritize foolery-0j4 (latency) as highest-impact bug.\nAssumptions:\n- foolery-b9r (blocker for c47) is resolved — c47 is tagged stage:retry with 1 attempt\n- foolery-cgc (blocker for i22, ra5) is resolved — both are tagged stage:retry\n- Waves can run sequentially but Wave 2 beads have no hard dependency on Wave 1 — sequencing is for practical agent management\n- All unassigned beads are P1+ priority and excluded from this P0 plan"
