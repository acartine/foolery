    "description": "beads is an overly complicated, buggy mess that actually is 100% not working right now.  We need to create an abstraction layer so that we can build something else as a database backend.  This bead is not to build a new database - it's to build an abstraction layer and a \"beads\" implementation.  So no new user-facing functionality - just a separation of requirements from implementation."
