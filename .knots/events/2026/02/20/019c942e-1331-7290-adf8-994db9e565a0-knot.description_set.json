    "description": "Objective: Introduce runtime wiring so application code depends on the abstraction, not beads directly.\n\nNotes: Factory/config tasks can proceed in parallel with boundary refactors in separate modules.\n\nAssigned tasks:\n- Add backend factory and dependency injection seam\n- Add internal backend selection configuration\n- Refactor shared layers to consume BackendPort\n- Add temporary stub backend for incremental migration"
