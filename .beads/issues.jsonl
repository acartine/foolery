Select dropdowns (type/status/priority): Changed onValueChange from returning Promise to fire-and-forget via new `fireUpdate()` helper that calls onUpdate().catch(). Changed SelectTrigger from h-7 to h-auto and added cursor-pointer.\n2. Labels: Replaced click-to-edit-all with individual X buttons per label using removeLabels API + an \"+ Add\" button with inline input for new labels\n3. Added savingRef to prevent double-saves on blur\n4. saveEdit state reset moved to finally{} block\n\n## Remaining open P0 beads:\n- foolery-79u: bead detail editing - changes written but need build test + verify\n- foolery-3of: condense padding everywhere (50% on /beads, 75% on detail)\n- foolery-ojo: logo PNG corners not cleaned up (only CSS rounded was added)\n- foolery-6p6: hierarchy view doesn't work - bd list --json doesn't return parent field, only bd show does.

{"id":"foolery-ad6","title":"Investigate how application handles multiple open clients","description":"given that the application is stateful - how does it handle multiple clients?  does it namespace things like \"selected repo?\"","notes":"## Multi-Client Investigation Findings\n\n### Architecture Summary\nThe app is a Next.js application with:\n- **Client state**: Zustand store (src/stores/app-store.ts) — in-memory only, no persistence middleware\n- **Server state**: Stateless API routes that shell out to the `bd` CLI (src/lib/bd.ts)\n- **Data fetching**: TanStack Query with 10s refetchInterval for live polling\n- **Persistent storage**: Only localStorage for page-size preference (key: foolery-page-size)\n\n### Stateful Elements Analyzed\n\n1. **Selected Repo (activeRepo)** — Zustand in-memory store\n   - Each browser tab/window gets its own Zustand store instance\n   - Tabs do NOT share or conflict on activeRepo selection\n   - No cross-tab synchronization exists\n   - VERDICT: Safe. Each tab is independent.\n\n2. **Filters (status/type/priority)** — Zustand in-memory store\n   - Same as activeRepo — per-tab, no cross-tab conflict\n   - VERDICT: Safe.\n\n3. **Search query** — URL search params (?q=...)\n   - Encoded in URL, not shared across tabs\n   - VERDICT: Safe.\n\n4. **View mode, command palette state, row selection, focused row** — Zustand + React state\n   - All per-tab, in-memory\n   - VERDICT: Safe.\n\n5. **Page size preference** — localStorage (foolery-page-size)\n   - Shared across ALL tabs/windows on the same origin\n   - If a user changes page size in Tab A, Tab B will pick it up on next read (e.g., after page refresh or re-mount)\n   - NOT a conflict issue — this is a benign user preference, and cross-tab sharing is actually desirable\n   - VERDICT: Safe. Shared intentionally.\n\n6. **Registry (repo list)** — File on disk (~/.config/foolery/registry.json)\n   - Server-side, read from disk on every API call (no caching)\n   - Adding/removing repos in one tab is visible to other tabs on next refetch (TanStack Query polling)\n   - VERDICT: Safe. File-based, no concurrent write locking needed for this low-frequency operation.\n\n7. **Bead data (CRUD)** — Delegated to `bd` CLI, which operates on .beads/issues.jsonl files\n   - All mutations go through the bd CLI which handles its own file locking\n   - Server is stateless — no in-process cache of bead data\n   - Multiple tabs can update beads concurrently; each sees updates via polling\n   - VERDICT: Safe. Stateless server + CLI handles concurrency.\n\n### Cross-Tab Behavior Summary\n- **No shared mutable client state** between tabs (Zustand is per-instance)\n- **No BroadcastChannel, SharedWorker, or storage event listeners** for cross-tab sync\n- **Polling (10s interval)** provides eventual consistency across tabs for server data\n- The only shared state (localStorage page-size) is a benign preference\n\n### Potential Improvements (Not Bugs)\n- Cross-tab sync of activeRepo selection could be added via localStorage + storage events or BroadcastChannel, but this is a UX preference, not a bug\n- TanStack Query's refetchOnWindowFocus (default: true) helps tabs stay fresh when switching between them\n\n### Conclusion\n**No multi-client issues found.** The architecture correctly isolates per-tab UI state in Zustand (in-memory only, no persist middleware) and delegates all data mutations to the stateless server/CLI layer. Multiple open clients operate independently without conflicts.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"cartine@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-11T07:10:19.400035+01:00","created_by":"Andrew Cartine","updated_at":"2026-02-11T12:22:36.138879+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-11T12:22:36.138879+01:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["stage:verification"]}
