Select dropdowns (type/status/priority): Changed onValueChange from returning Promise to fire-and-forget via new `fireUpdate()` helper that calls onUpdate().catch(). Changed SelectTrigger from h-7 to h-auto and added cursor-pointer.\n2. Labels: Replaced click-to-edit-all with individual X buttons per label using removeLabels API + an \"+ Add\" button with inline input for new labels\n3. Added savingRef to prevent double-saves on blur\n4. saveEdit state reset moved to finally{} block\n\n## Remaining open P0 beads:\n- foolery-79u: bead detail editing - changes written but need build test + verify\n- foolery-3of: condense padding everywhere (50% on /beads, 75% on detail)\n- foolery-ojo: logo PNG corners not cleaned up (only CSS rounded was added)\n- foolery-6p6: hierarchy view doesn't work - bd list --json doesn't return parent field, only bd show does. Need different approach (maybe use dependencies or fetch parent per-bead)\n- foolery-d0l: in stage:verification, test reject button\n- foolery-d45: in stage:verification, test column order\n\n## Key technical findings:\n- bd CLI: --set-labels \"\" is a NO-OP (doesn't clear labels). Must use --remove-label instead.\n- bd list --json does NOT return parent field. bd show --json does. Hierarchy needs a different data source.\n- bd update accepts: --title, --description, --acceptance, --notes, --type, --status, --priority, --set-labels, --remove-label, --add-label\n- All worktrees cleaned up, branches deleted, code is on main",
