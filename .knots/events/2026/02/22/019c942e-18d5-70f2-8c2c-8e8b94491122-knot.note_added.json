README documents first-run command and upgrade path.\nIntegrated to origin/main in commit 5bfcfbc (2026-02-16).\nPost-release validation: public installer command from README was executed against v0.1.0 artifact () and succeeded end-to-end with foolery start/status/stop and log file output.\nValidation detail: install was run with FOOLERY_RELEASE_TAG=v0.1.0 using the raw installer URL from README.\nCorrection: installer/launcher no longer require Bun for runtime; installs now run as Node-based app from release artifact.",
